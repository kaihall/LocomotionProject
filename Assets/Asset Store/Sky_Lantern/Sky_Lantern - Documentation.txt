Load "Sky_Lantern.unity" for an example scene, or simply drag the sky lantern from the Prefab folder (in the Project window) into the Hierarchy window.

The lantern has several settings to let you control its movement; select the lantern in the hierarchy window, then in the Inspector window you'll see several parameters. "Lantern Float Speed" is the speed that the lantern ascends. When its speed reaches "Lantern Float Top Speed" it will stop accelerating and continue to ascend at this speed. You can apply additional forces to the lantern (to simulate the wind, for example) by applying values under the "Constant Force" section.

Have fun!
